WELCOME TO THE LOST SOULS ADVENTURE GAME README:

INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO INSTALL ON YOUR SYSTEM:
    - 1st Simply download the code files, which will be a run python file and a main html file

    - Next make sure you have installed the python language on your system and that html is compatible with you device.

    - Finally after your IDE is setup and the correct language is now installed onto your system it should be a case of running the run.py file and then this will open a web browser with the game loaded in.

    - NOTE: This is still a huge work in progress and is actively being updated (21/11/2025)

    - Expect monthly to every 2 months for an update!

Thanks for checking my software out and feel free to look at any of my other projects too!
